## Notes

### Why? 
I recently started DJing and created this app for use in trying to find similar **EDM** songs through its musical elements and waveforms rather than just "important" factors like Key or Tempo.

### Next steps.
Songs need to be downloaded for them to be embedded and searched, and Spotify's API actually does NOT let you download music for ML purposes. Thankfully, I've found a temporary "workaround" - Googling "spotify downloader" and attempting to use their APIs or using Playwright/Selenium to automate downloading songs.

Unfortunately, the owners of said API has added protection, so a new method is being looked into for adding new songs!
